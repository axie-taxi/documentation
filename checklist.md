# Checklist for using Axie.Taxi
- [ ] Are all of the team addresses in the same wallet? If not, you won't easily be able use Axie.Taxi, and you should hit us up in Discord for special assistance.
- [ ] If you already have a Metamask account that is different from your guild account, you should create a [new chrome profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) to use with Axie.Taxi so you don't have to replace your existing wallet.
- [ ] Is your Ronin wallet seed phrase imported into Metamask? You'll need to export your Ronin seed phrase and import it into Metamask for Axie.Taxi to work. NOTE: You do not need to link your Metamask to Ronin in the Axie Infinity marketplace. Simply importing your seed phrase will work.
- [ ] Are all of your team addresses actually added to metamask? As in, when you click on Metamask, do you see all of your guild team accounts in this dropdown menu? <img width="311" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 11 32 41 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10891675/151018621-7dd293dd-a656-43b8-b90c-61f1dc996812.png">
- [ ] Is your *guild treasury address* your currently active Metamask account? You'll need this to be true when you create your guild. For most guilds, this will simply be the first account in your wallet.

If you've already gotten to the "account creation" step and something is wrong with your Metamask setup, I'd recommend signing out of Axie.Taxi, fixing your Metamask setup, and then logging in *again.*
