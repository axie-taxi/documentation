## How to use it
- Import your Ronin seed phrase into Metamask (we recommend using a separate Chrome profile for Axie.Taxi if you have an existing Metamask wallet already.
- Press the "create account" button a bunch of times (for as many accounts as you have in your Ronin wallet, for all of your teams)
- Create a guild on [axie.taxi](https://axie.taxi), MAKING SURE to sign in the first time with your guild treasury account
- Go to the `/app/teams` page and click "automate all" to automate all teams
- Now, whenever a new claim comes in, the dashboard should update with the total claimed SLP.
